                    My name is Joe Wright, and I am currently in school at the UNC CH bootcamp to becoming a full stack development engineer.  
                    My past experience has been in the e-commerce industry, where I've always worked in data analytics and business intelligence.
                    I am in this program because I'd like to migrate my creative skill set into my technical skill set, focusing on developing a new career in ux/ui development.

                <p>
                    My hobbies include music, art, spending time with my lovable dog and cat, and camping/general outdoorsmanship.
                    I've been playing guitar since I was four years old, and often joke that I can play literally anything with strings on it.
                    My most recent passion is the violin, which I've been working on mastering for a couple of years now.
                    I've been a gallery artist for the last decade, and have been working in digital design for a couple of years now.
